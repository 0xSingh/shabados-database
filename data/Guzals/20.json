              "translation": "It would be a great sin if my mind still desires to have pearls and thrones.\" (31) (2)\nIf a chemist can convert copper into gold, then it is not impossible for\nThe heavenly pond to convert one grain of its soil into a radiant sun. (31) (3)\nIf you can meet the Providence, consider it as a miracle;\nIn fact, search for Him is the highst prize for his seekers. (31) (4)\nAnyone who listens to the poetry of Goyaa with his heart and soul,\nHe will not then care for the gems and pearls in a jewelers shop. (31) (5)\nA sugar bubble is no match to the beauty and touch of your closed lips,\nThis is not a cliché. It is the truth unsurpassed. This is the best example that I can present here. (32) (1)\nIf You are yearning for a meeting with Him, then get used to 'separation',\nSeparation is the only guide. If there is no one to steer your way, how can you ever reach your destination? (32) (2)\nDo not let go the hem of the (hands of) eyelids just as the eyelids are holding on to the eyes until,\nYour pocket of wishes is not filled with diamonds and pearls. (32) (3)\nThe branch (of the tree) of hope of a lover never blossoms unless\nIt receives irrigation from the drops of water (tears) of the eyelids. (32) (4)\nO you dunce Goyaa! Why are you engaging in useless talk? Do not brag about your love for him, the Guru,\nBecause, only those who have already had their heads severed from their bodies are entitled to tread this path. (32) (5)\nThe aroma of spring flowers of Holi festival makes the whole garden, the world, full of special fragrance.\nAnd gave the blossoming bud-like lips a pleasant disposition. (33) (1)\nThe Akaalpurakh spread the roses, the sky, the fragrance of musk and               \nsandalwood all over like the raindrops. (33) (2)\nHow beautiful and effective is a saffron filled squirt pump?\nThat it converts even the discolored and the ugly into colorful and aromatic. (33) (3)\nWith the throwing of powdered red color by his holy hands on me\nIt made both the earth and the heaven all crimsen colored for me. (33 ) (4)\nWith His grace, both the worlds began to bathe in colorful dispositions,\nWhen he put shiny clothes suitable for only rich people on my neck. (33) (5)\nAnyone who was fortunate to get a sacred glimpse of Him, the Guru,\nTake it that he, surely, was able to fulfill his lifelong desire. (33) (6)\nGoyaa says, \"If I could sacrifice myself for the dust of the path traversed by noble souls,    ",
