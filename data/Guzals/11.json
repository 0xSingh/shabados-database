(17) (1)\nWhen my moon, while waking up from his day-sleep, came out,\nIt was as if he was imprecating the posture of the morning sun. (17) (2)\nWhen you, the Guru, emerged with your sleepy eyes from your Bed of love,\nThe morning sun was chagrined and abashed to compare itself with the radiance of your face. (17) (3)\nWhen the slumbering morning sun takes off his veil from its face,\nWith its fortunate arrival, it brings (day)light to the whole world. (17) (4)\nThe whole life of worldly people is an unending night-long vigil and is an ever lasting amnesia,\nGoyaa says, \"However, for me, sleeping during the wee hours of the morning will be forbidden, sinful and morally wrong from now on.\" (17) (5)\nThis playful eye attracts and takes away my breath, heart and faith,\nAnd it is the same lively eye that brings me out of my worries and sorrowful times. (18) (1)\nOne of his locks of hair can create a calamity and disaster in the world,\nAnd just one of his eyes can bless the whole world with prosperity. (18) (2)\nGoyaa is praying, \"Wish my heart becomes the dust of the feet of my beloved (Guru) - humility,",
