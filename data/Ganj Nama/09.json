              "translation": "The Nineth Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji. The nineth Guru, Guru Teg Bahadur Ji, with a new agenda was the chief of the heads of protectors of the truth. He was the ornate of the honored and proud throne of the Lord of both the worlds. In spite of the fact that he was the master of divine power, he still would always acquiesce and bow before the will and command of Waaheguru and was the mysterious instrument for the godly glory and majestic grandeur. His personality was such that he had the capability of putting those who were his chaste and loyal followers to a severe test and to invigorate those devotees who follow an impartial methodology. The travelers on the grand divine path and the inhabitants of the next world were existent due to his personality that was totally dependent on truth and was a close companion of the highest spiritual power. He was the crown of the specialy selected devotees and the coronet of the proponents of God's adherents with truthful virtues. The blessed 'Tay' in his name was a believer in living under His will and command. The Farsi 'Yay' was the indicative of complete faith; the blessed Farsi 'Kaaf\" ('Gaggaa') was representing his god-blessed personality as an embodiment of humility from head to his feet; The 'Bay' along with 'Hay' was the adornment of the social and cultural party in education and teaching. The truth-compiled 'Alif' was the embellishment of the truth; the infinitely formed 'Daal' in his name was the just and fair ruler of both the worlds. The last 'Ray' understood and appreciated the divine mysteries and was the rightful foundation of the highest truth.",
