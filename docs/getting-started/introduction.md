## Motivation & Aims
> An open-source, collaborative Gurbani database for *all*.

Shabad OS database is a sustainable, collaborative effort for the Sangat, by the Sangat, to produce the most accurate and wholesome Gurbani database for all to use, whether you're building a Gurbani app, or doing Gurbani research and analysis.



 allowing others to focus on **innovation** and not spend time reinventing the wheel.

## Benefits

### Fully open-source
Open-source means that the database's contents, history, and modifications are [publicly accessible](https://github.com/shabados/database). Our commitment to open-source allows us to achieve **inclusive collaboration** and focus on building a **sustainable**, **reusable** database that is not controlled or owned by anyone, but can be used by **everyone**.

We're also able to apply licensing that protects the database from non-public modification yet effectively still grants the ownership of the database to the public (see [licensing](licensing) for more details).

Most importantly, open-source means work on the database can always be carried forward by the **community**.

### Quality
With over 6,000 corrections, we've built upon the work of iGurbani, SikhiToTheMax, and GurbaniNow databases. We've even consolidated our efforts with the [GurbaniNow Team](https://GurbaniNow.com) as part of our aim to maintain the most accurate Gurbani database.

A modern [schema](getting-started/schema) has been designed to capture data in the most effective way, ideal for developing apps, carrying out data analysis, and undertaking research.

The database is also SGPC compliant, allowing any developed software to be used in Gurdwaras across the world. 

### Contributions
Anyone may contribute and discuss decisions or raised issues. Work with us and contribute via the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/shabados/database) to consolidate the Panthic effort! We're happy to work with invidiuals and organisations of all levels in the name of positive progress

### Updates

### APIs
